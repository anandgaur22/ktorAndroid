# KTOR in Android

## What is Ktor?
Ktor is an **asynchronous** and **lightweight** HTTP client designed for Kotlin. It is used for making **network requests**, **WebSockets**, **authentication**, **JSON parsing**, and even **backend server development**.

### In Simple Words:
- Similar to **Retrofit**, but more **flexible** and **lightweight**.
- Built-in support for **Kotlin Coroutines**, making API requests faster and more efficient.
- **Multiplatform** (Can be used on **Android, iOS, and Backend**).

---

## Why Should You Use Ktor? 🤔
✅ **Full Kotlin Support** – 100% Kotlin-first library, making it ideal for Android development.  
✅ **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking** – Uses **Coroutines**, making it fast and efficient.  
✅ **Lightweight & Minimal Dependencies** – More lightweight than **Retrofit**.  
✅ **Customizable** – Allows modification of request/response handling, headers, and logging.  
✅ **Built-in Serialization** – Direct support for `kotlinx.serialization` for JSON parsing.  
✅ **WebSockets & Real-Time Communication** – Supports **WebSockets**, unlike Retrofit.  
✅ **Multiplatform Support** – Works on **Android, iOS, and Backend**, enabling code reuse.

## Ktor vs Retrofit – Which One is Better? 🤯

| Feature          | Retrofit 🚀 | Ktor ⚡ |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| **Language**     | Java + Kotlin | Pure Kotlin |
| **Coroutines Support** | Extra dependency required (CallAdapter) | Native support |
| **Performance**  | Fast, but heavy | Faster & Lightweight |
| **Customization** | Limited | Highly customizable |
| **Serialization** | Gson / Moshi | Kotlinx.serialization |
| **WebSockets**   | ❌ No | ✅ Yes, built-in support |
| **Multiplatform** | ❌ Android only | ✅ Android, iOS, Backend |

### ✅ When to Use **Retrofit**?
- If you **only** need to make **simple API calls**.
- If you are working on an **existing Java-based project**.
- If your team is already familiar with Retrofit and does not want to switch.

### ✅ When to Use **Ktor**?
- If you are developing a **Kotlin-first** project.
- If your architecture is based on **Coroutines & Flow**.
- If you need **WebSockets, real-time updates, or GraphQL**.
- If you need **Multiplatform support (Android + iOS)**.

## Components of Ktor (Simplified)

1️⃣ **Ktor Client** – Handles API calls.  
2️⃣ **Request Builder** – Defines API call structure (GET, POST, etc.).  
3️⃣ **Response Handling** – Parses data received from API.  
4️⃣ **Interceptors & Logging** – Modifies or logs request/response.  
5️⃣ **Serialization** – Converts JSON or XML into objects.
